Roblox Player Pro is a full replacement for the laggy Roblox desktop app, now with Bloxstrap support (check desc.). I found the web version of Roblox pretty good so I put it into Chrome kiosk and made an app that opens it and replaces the desktop version.
### Note: It might take a couple of seconds for Roblox to load when you join an experience!
### Note: The program might take a couple of seconds to close! Don't spam-press the hotkey, or else you'll close Chrome too!

# Preparations
1. Install Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/next-steps.html)
   (Or run "Winget install Google.Chrome")
   
# How to use 
It is straightforward, follow the instructions below!

## (Optional) Add Roblox Chrome extensions
Before you start using the web version of Roblox, you may want to customize it using extensions. Here are some examples:  
Rogold - http://www.rogold.live                        
Ropro - http://www.ropro.io                        
BTRoblox - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hbkpclpemjeibhioopcebchdmohaieln                             

## 1. Double-click on the .exe file
This will open up Roblox inside the Chrome kiosk.
### Press ctrl+alt+y to quit Roblox/Chrome (If you close Chrome, you close the .exe file so reopen it to relaunch the Roblox web version.)

## (Optional) Add the Roblox Player Pro to startup
By doing this, you won't have to open the Py file all the time because it will automatically open when you turn on your computer.
To do this you need to press Win+r. This will open up run. Now you should type in "shell:startup" and hit enter. Now you have to copy Roblox Player Pro.exe to the folder that it just opened.
